# Meals Planner (prototype)

The App helps to plan meals for several days.
You can already create new meals, search them by ingredients, and put some meals into the plan!
The App doesn't have a backend yet, but now the data is stored on the local storage.
It is developing App in the early stage and it is prototyping for mobile screens for now.
In the future, I plan to develop grocery list and pantry list pages to better understand what product do you need to buy for a week.
